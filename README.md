# Egg-basket-game-python
I had made this Project on Pygame. It is a  Game named Egg Drop. Its functionality is as follows...
On opening the Game first there comes the menu in which there are two buttons for Start and Quit. 
Basically they are not buttons . I had drawn two rectangles on the Screen and with the help of 
some  code i had made them to appear like the real buttons. On clicking the Quit button it closes the Pygame window.
On clicking the Start button the Game Starts. The Screen is 800X600 in dimensions. There appears one basket on the bottom on the Screen. On pressing the left arrow key it moves  with a value of -15 towards the x axis and on pressing the right arrow key it moves with a value of 15 towards the x axis .
I had used a Random function for the falling of eggs at the Random Positions.When the player catches the egg, 
the score increases by a value of 1 every time and if the player misses the egg then his game is over.
There is also one Pause funtion for pausing the game. But there is one limitation that the Score before 
Pausing  is not maintained after the pause button.
It starts again from 0. I tried to figure out this problem but due to the time limit i am unable to do so. 
I will find out it later.  Besides this the Game intro function is similar as the function which are found in other games.
